# Flash-Load: Ethereum Smart Contract Project

The **Flash-Load** project is an Ethereum-based decentralized application built to demonstrate and test flash loans or similar on-chain interactions. The project leverages **Hardhat** as the development framework and uses **Mocha** and **Chai** for writing and running tests.

## Features

- Smart contract development and deployment on Ethereum.
- Flash loan implementation (or similar on-chain functionalities).
- Testing suite for validating contract functionality.
- Local Ethereum development environment for rapid iteration.

## Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Framework**: Hardhat
- **Testing**: Mocha and Chai
- **Network**: Ethereum (supports local, testnets, and mainnet)

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v14 or higher
- **npm**: v6 or higher
- **Hardhat**: Installed as a development dependency
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for testing on testnets.
